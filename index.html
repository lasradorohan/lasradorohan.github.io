                    <h2>More about my interests</h2>
                </header>
                <p>As I journey through my undergraduate years my interest in the fields of Machine Learning and
                    Deep Learning have deepened. At the same time I developed a soft spot for Android Development and
                    curiosity towards Parallel Computing.

                <p>With my goal being to make meaningful contributions in the field of Applied Machine Learning, I
                    constantly endeavor to equip and upskill myself with knowledge and experience in this field via
                    courses, projects and internships. My projects include Generative Face Completion, Image distortion
                    correction, Facial expression detection. I also interned at L&T Infotech and IIT Ropar where I did
                    projects in this field. I am currently exploring sequence generation and prediction via the
                    application of modelling pen strokes.</p>

                <p>I have also worked on Android development in two of my projects. I have experience in Android with
                    Kotlin with both the standard XML based UI and the new UI toolkit called Jetpack Compose. I took a
                    shallow dive in GPU computing by coding a terminal based image tool that runs on the GPU.</p>

                <p>A review paper on Novel Consensus Algorithms in Blockchain presented by me at an International
                    Symposium organized by VIT, was well received.</p>

                                <h2>GAN based Generative Face Completion</h2>
                                <p>This project involved finding a way to generate the missing parts in images from the
                                    existing sections. To simplify the task a bit, I decided to fix the region which was
                                    missing, specifically the right half of images.<br><br>

                                    This was an individual project to explore the working of GANs.<br><br>

                                    At this time, I had learnt about the ability of certain neural networks to generate
                                    more data similar to existing data, mostly GANs. More commonly GANs were used to
                                    unconditionally generate similar looking images. However, my aim was to generate
                                    missing halves such that it matches with the existing half.<br><br>

                                    I also experimented with LSTMs for this task, as LSTM had been previously used for
                                    various tasks involving generating novel sequences, but didn't achieve good results.
                                    <br>
                                    This is when I came across Pix2Pix GANs, a neural network architecture able to
                                    generatively map images to images.<br><br>

                                    <span class="image r-left"><img src="images/pix2pix.png" alt=""></span>

                                    Pix2Pix GANs consist of 2 competing networks. A U-Net generator, which is like a
                                    convolutional auto-encoder but with skip connections between encoding and decoding
                                    layers of same shape, originally used for the biological segmentation task. And a
                                    PatchGAN discriminator, a convolutional downsampling network being trained to
                                    discriminate between the generator's output and the ground truth.<br><br>

                                    With the help of some tutorials on tensorflow.org, I coded the data input pipeline
                                    and
                                    the model architecture for the Pix2Pix GAN. I trained it on the CELEB-Faces dataset,
                                    splitting the images in halves. It was able to generate visually satisfactory
                                    results.<br><br>

                                <h2>Deep learning-based approach for correction of wide-angle lens distortion</h2>
                                <p>Trained a Convolutional Neural Network to determine the wide-angle lens distortion
                                    coefficients in input images and used them to warp pixels back to their correct
                                    positions to undistort the images. <br><br>

                                    This project involved the detection and correction of wide angle distortion in
                                    single images without any additional information about the capturing device. This
                                    distortion is commonly recognized as a "barrel" effect, especially in fisheye lens
                                    cameras that try to capture a larger Field of View while sacrificing distortion
                                    effects.<br><br>

                                    The idea for this project came about from the knowledge of the ability of
                                    Convolutional Neural Networks to detect various artifacts/distortions in images,
                                    without focusing on the content of the image.<br><br>

                                    The first task was to learn about the mathematical process modelling said
                                    distortion. One such well-known process was Fitzgibbon's division model [Fitzgibbon,
                                    A. W. (2001)]<br><br>

                                    Further modifications were made to the formula to include a scale factor so that the
                                    distorted image does not contain any black boundaries
                                    The second task was to find a dataset that would provide images distorted with
                                    different intensities and their corresponding coefficients. As to the best of my
                                    googling, I couldn't find one, I decided to create my own.<br><br>
                                    I used the Indoor Scene Recognition dataset (
                                    http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/indoor.html) and manually randomly distorted the
                                    images to generate one. However in the process I had to discard around 7k images
                                    that were too blurry.<br><br>

                                    The next step was to train a CNN model to predict the coefficient.<br>
                                    For this I resized the images to 512×512, used XCeption network as the backbone,
                                    multiplied feature maps with a radial matrix, and added further convolution and
                                    dense layers to get the coefficient.<br><br>

                                    A simple interface was made with StreamLit python library, adding to the usability
                                    of the solution.<br><br>

                                    This project was performed for exploring the low level working of general purpose
                                    computation on the GPU using the CUDA GPGPU API in C++. For this, I selected the
                                    task as developing an image manipulation utility.<br><br>

                                    A team of four with I as the lead wrote the code for allocating memory, copying data
                                    over to the GPU, the GPU kernels executing block-wise on different SMs on the GPU,
                                    copying back the results and deallocating. This was done for each image command:
                                    rotation, gamma correction, radial distortion, contrast, sharpening, blur, skew and
                                    conversion to black and white.<br><br>

                                    I individually was also responsible for writing the command line based interface
                                    which allowed selecting multiple images, creating a pipeline consisting of multiple

                                    a command line interface.<br><br>

                                    The aim of this project was to develop a tree based file system that stores file in
                                    compressed form for storage efficiency. The idea for the project was an inspiration
                                    from file systems that store files in forms other than just their raw binary
                                    data.<br><br>

                                    The code for the command-line interface was written by me. Commands such as
                                    makefile, writefile, readfile, makefolder, import, export, delete, find, tree, etc.
                                    were implemented to make it close to a fully functional file system. An
                                    implementation of LZ77 compression algorithm in C++ was used to compress and
                                    decompress the files.<br><br>

                                    This project was performed to explore deployment of deep learning solutions in the
                                    web scenario, such that a user may be able to run the application locally in their
                                    browser.<br><br>

                                    Libraries such as TensorFlow.js for deployment in the browser and Danfo.js for
                                    accessing CSV data frames from a javascript environment were used. A CNN model based
                                    on MobileNetV2 was used to detect the user's expression.<br><br>

                                    A dataset providing "energy" and "valence" values (describing mood) and Spotify

                                    Most end to end encrypted chat applications today perform the text transactions over the web via some private servers. Our aim in this project was to bring encryption based security to the existing SMS text messaging so that users can communicate securely without connecting to the internet. Only connection to a web service is done in the app to provide the users with a customized contact list.<br><br>

                                    This project was done in a team of two, where I was responsible for making the application and UI and integrating it with AES encryption and decryption.<br><br>
